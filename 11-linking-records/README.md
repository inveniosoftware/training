# Tutorial 11 - Data models: link records using references

The goal of this tutorial is to learn how we can link records using references, with a technique similar to [JSON Reference](https://json-spec.readthedocs.io/reference.html).

In tutorial 08, we have learned how to create a new data model, the author record. It would be now very useful to link a record to the author so that, when using the REST APIs to return records, we can immediately return also the details of the author without performing any extra query.
For example, given the following record:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Invenio is awesome",
  "contributors": [
    {
      "name": "Kent, Clark"
    }
  ],
  "contributors_count": 1
}
```

and its author:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Goodman, Martin"
}
```

we would like that when we retrieve the record, the details of the author are automatically included in each record:

```json
{
  "author": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Goodman, Martin"
  },
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Invenio is awesome",
  "contributors": [
    {
      "name": "Kent, Clark"
    }
  ],
  "contributors_count": 1
}
```

How do we do it?

1. In the record data model, we define a `$ref` attribute that is an URL pointing to the author record.
2. When indexing the record, Invenio will find the `$ref` record and use the URL to retrieve the referenced author.
3. The URL is a Flask route that we have to define and implement and it will be called by Invenio. This won't be a real HTTP call (see below for more explanations).
4. The indexed record will contain the replaced object instead of the `$ref` field.

Let's implement it.

## Step 1: Bootstrap exercise

If you completed the previous tutorial, you can skip this step. If instead you would like to start from a clean state run the following commands:

```bash
cd ~/src/training/
./start-from.sh 10-indexing-records
```

## Step 2: Add author reference to the record

We need to create a reference (in a similar way as we would do using foreign keys in the SQL world) between record and author. Let's add a new `$ref` field in the record data model to reference the author.

`my-site/my_site/records/jsonschemas/records/record-v1.0.0.json`

```diff
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
+   "author": {
+     "type": "object",
+     "properties": {
+       "$ref": {
+         "type": "string"
+       }
+     },
+     "required": ["$ref"]
+   },
    "title": {
      "description": "Record title.",
      "type": "string"
    },
```

Since we have changed the data model, we need to change the Elasticsearch mappings because you want to search records by author metadata.

`my-site/my_site/records/mappings/v7/records/record-v1.0.0.json`

```diff
+       "author": {
+         "type": "object",
+         "properties": {
+           "id": {
+             "type": "integer"
+           },
+           "name": {
+             "type": "text"
+           }
+         }
+       },
         "id": {
          "type": "keyword"
        },
```

## Step 3: Create a JSON resolver

What will now happen is that when creating a new record, there will be a new `$ref` field with the URL to resolve the related author. For example, `$ref: https://my-site.com/api/resolver/author/1`.

When indexing, the `invenio-indexer` module will find the `$ref` field and, instead of calling the URL and performing the HTTP request, it will try to find if there is a Flask route registered with that URL. In that case, it will execute the method of the route itself and replace the `$ref` field with the output of the method. This method is a called `JSON resolver`.

Let's create a new file:

`my-site/my_site/records/jsonresolvers.py`

```python
"""Author resolver."""

from __future__ import absolute_import, print_function

import jsonresolver
from invenio_pidstore.resolver import Resolver
from invenio_records.api import Record


# the host corresponds to the config value for the key JSONSCHEMAS_HOST
@jsonresolver.route('/api/resolver/author/<authid>', host='my-site.com')
def record_jsonresolver(authid):
    """Resolve referenced author."""
    # Setup a resolver to retrieve an author record given its id
    resolver = Resolver(pid_type='authid', object_type="rec", getter=Record.get_record)
    _, record = resolver.resolve(str(authid))
    # we could manipulate here the record and eventually add/remove fields
    del record['$schema']
    return record
```

## Step 4: Update the entrypoints

We need to add the JSON resolver method in the entrypoints.

`my-site/setup.py`

```diff
            'authors = my_site.authors.jsonschemas',
        ],
+       "invenio_records.jsonresolver": [
+           "author = my_site.records.jsonresolvers",
+       ],
        'invenio_search.mappings': [
            'records = my_site.records.mappings',
```

## Step 5: Try it

We can now try to create an author and then a record with a reference to it. But first, since we have changed schema, mappings and entrypoints, let's re-install the app and re-init DB and Elasticsearch.

```bash
pipenv run pip install -e .
./scripts/setup
./scripts/server
```

Create a new author:

```bash
curl -k --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --request POST \
    --data '{"name": "Goodman, Martin"}' \
    "https://127.0.0.1:5000/api/authors/?prettyprint=1"
firefox http://127.0.0.1:9200/authors/_search?pretty=true
```

Now, stop the server.
Create a new record. In the `$ref` field, we will put the route URL that we have defined in the JSON resolver method. To use the REST API, we would have to change the loaders, since the `author` field is not defined. Let's create the record using the CLI.

```bash
cd ~/src/my-site
echo '{"author": { "$ref": "https://my-site.com/api/resolver/author/1" }, "title": "Invenio is awesome", "contributors": [{"name": "Kent, Clark"}], "owner": 1}' | pipenv run invenio records create --pid-minter recid
```

Let's re-index the newly create record so that the `$ref` attribute will be replaced:

```bash
pipenv run invenio index reindex --pid-type recid --yes-i-know
pipenv run invenio index run
```

Now, we can query Elasticsearch and verify that the author metadata are in the record.

```bash
./scripts/server
firefox http://127.0.0.1:9200/records/_search?pretty=true
```

If, instead, we check what's in the database (using the Admin panel) we can see that the record has still the `$ref` field:

```bash
# create an admin user
pipenv run invenio users create admin@invenio.org --password 123456 --active
pipenv run invenio roles add admin@invenio.org admin
firefox https://127.0.0.1:5000/admin/persistentidentifier/
```

## Bonus

Did you notice that the `contributors_count` field is also showing up in the author records?

```bash
firefox http://127.0.0.1:9200/authors/_search?pretty=true
```

Can you guess why? How can we fix it?

## About references in Invenio

Invenio uses the [jsonresolver](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/jsonresolver) module to define and resolve references between records. The `$ref` URL is generated using an host domain defined by the config variable `JSONSCHEMA_HOST` (it is not meant to be an existing URL) to be able to avoid performing real HTTP request when resolving but instead calling a Flask route method implementation.

Given that it is an internal reference, you should not expose this field and URL when returning the schema and the records through APIs. To avoid that, by default [invenio-records-rest](https://invenio-records-rest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html) JSON serializers defines `replace_refs=True` as parameter.
Moreover, as you saw, the URL will be hard-coded in each record. If you need to change it, you will have most probably to perform an update to all your records.

To hide references and solve this problem, we recommend you to create your own record class and add the `author` field creation in the overridden `create` method. In this way, everything you create a record, the `$ref` is automatically generated. As reference, here an example:

```python
class MyRecord(Record):

    _schema = "myrecords/myrecord-v1.0.0.json"

    @classmethod
    def create(cls, data, id_=None, **kwargs):
        """Create MyRecord record."""
        data["$schema"] = current_jsonschemas.path_to_url(cls._schema)
        data["author"] = {
            "$ref": "http://mysite.com/resolver/{}".format(data['author_id'])
        }
        return super(MyRecord, cls).create(data, id_=id_, **kwargs)
```
